Sit down and ask your mom what she had to go through when she got her MBA and started working in a man's world. And her ambitions and potential she forwent when she made the decision to stand behind your father as he pursued a career and she stayed home to keep you, your brother, and your sister safe.

Ask.

Cause I never stopped asking myself why you came to me for intel on DEI when your mother holds the same knowledge as me and more wisdom as a woman navigating a ‚ôÇÔ∏è üåé.

People think I sell myself when I enter a room or a bar without a man by my side. Yt ri$h men hand me their business cards and try to invite me to their room even when their daughter is with them and lay witness to my predicament as it unfolds as if it's a norm. 

Were you expecting to live vicariously through me to ramp up on DEI instead of doing the leg work?

Ask your mom what it was like. Because I was always worried for my mom growing up, even to this day as she continues working as a SWE for the government.

Go ahead Alex, ask.

If you care oh so much about DEI.
